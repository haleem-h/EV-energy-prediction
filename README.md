EV Energy Prediction using Machine Learning

This project focuses on predicting **energy consumption of Electric Vehicles (EVs)** using Machine Learning techniques. This project builds a Machine Learning model to predict EV energy consumption
based on charging and usage data.

Solution Overview:
The project follows a standard ML pipeline:
1. Data loading and cleaning
2. Feature engineering (charging duration, time features, etc.)
3. Target variable creation (energy consumption levels)
5. Model training using Machine Learning
6. Prediction using a trained model

Technologies Used:
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Joblib
